  "message": "Nebulang does not translate animated text correctly when the animation reveals content character-by-character or word-by-word. These animations split the text into multiple <span> elements, causing the translator to treat each fragment as a separate element and translate it literally. To avoid this issue, apply the text animation with the \"Element\" option enabled, so the text remains a single DOM element.",
